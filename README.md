# Dynamic-Button-Workflow
A React-based two-page app where users can create and customize button actions dynamically. The Config Page allows setting the button label, adding/removing actions like alerts, text/images display, resizing, localStorage operations, and reordering actions. The Output Page renders the button and executes the configured actions in sequence on click.
